This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll is very strict with how these files are named, so pay attention. It must follow the convention YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-my-post.md. This file name gets translated into the permalink for the blog post.

Because these are .md (markdown) files, you'll have to follow the markdown syntax ([cheat sheet](https://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf)).
